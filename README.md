ü™¶ Problem Statement:
=======================
The quality of concrete is determined by its compressive strength, which is measured
using a conventional crushing test on a concrete cylinder. 

The strength of the concrete is also a vital aspect in achieving the requisite longevity. 
It will take 28 days to test strength, which is a long period. 

So, what will we do now? We can save a lot of time and effort by using Data Science 
to estimate how much quantity of which raw material we need for acceptable compressive strength

‚ùáÔ∏è AIM : 

To build a solution that should able to predict the compressive strength of the concrete.(Using Machine Learning)

‚ùáÔ∏è APPROACH: 

The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. 
           Different machine learning algorithms that‚Äôs best fit for the above case will be tried out.
